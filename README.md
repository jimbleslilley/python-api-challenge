Three trends / insights for WeatherPy

* Temperature is affected by latitude. 

Increasing distance from the equator leads to a decrease in max temperature.

* Cloudiness is weakly affected by latitude. 

Warmer cities are more likely to experience less rain and consequently, less clouds. Across both plots we can see a correlation between deviating from the equator and an increase in cloudiness. However, this is not a strong correlation. 

* Humidity and Latitude 

In both the north and south hemisphere, there is a weak correlation between deviating from the equator and an increase in humidity.
